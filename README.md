# Horarium — Rule of Life Tracker

Live at https://horarium.us

A Progressive Web App for a small men’s group at St. Agatha St. James parish (West Philadelphia) to track a shared rule of life across the liturgical year — prayer, fasting, almsgiving, fraternity, stewardship, and asceticism.

**Tagline:** *A faithful rhythm for every season.*

## Features

- **Daily checklist** across six categories: Prayer, Fasting, Almsgiving & Works of Charity, Fraternity, Stewardship, and Asceticism
- **Progress tracking** with a visual progress bar and day counter
- **Daily notes** with auto-save
- **Date navigation** through the current season with a “Go to Today” shortcut
- **Weekly item tracking** (e.g., 2/3 exercise sessions completed this week)
- **Offline support** via Service Worker with cache-first strategy
- **Optional user accounts** for syncing data across multiple devices
- **Brother accountability** — invite a brother to see each other’s progress
- **Installable** as a standalone app on mobile (PWA) or via the Android TWA wrapper

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks, no build step)
- **Backend:** PHP + MySQL
- **Auth:** Token-based (64-character hex Bearer tokens)
- **Hosting:** Apache with HTTPS

## Data Sync

Checklist data is stored in `localStorage` for offline use. Users who create an account get automatic server sync with timestamp-based conflict resolution (most recent change wins).

## Setup

1. Serve the project root with Apache (HTTPS recommended). Canonical host: `horarium.us`.
2. Copy `api/private/secrets.example.php` to `api/private/secrets.php` and fill in your MySQL credentials.
3. Run the SQL scripts in `api/private/` to create the database tables.
4. Visit the app in a browser and optionally install it to your home screen.
